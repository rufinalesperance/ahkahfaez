Хотела бы узнать о побочных действиях Пьем пармелию уже много лет, как переехали в Казахстан.  Looking for some opinions on how to reclaim some yard for my kids to enjoy. We’ve got a small yard lacking privacy and with very little lawn area for kids and family to enjoy. There’s a lot of ledge, stumps, and random shrubs which make the vast majority of the lot unusable. We’ve had a couple landscapers come out and got two different opinions. I know next to nothing about these kinds of projects and thought I might ask you all for some thoughts. Here’s the album: https://imgur.com/a/zVNZDE. My boyfriend is a narc. So I moved in with my mom and stepdad. I just figured out that my stepdad is a covert narc. So I called my dad. And he essentially blamed me. Said my boyfriend is probably frustrated with me because I don't have a plan after my newborn gets older. Said my stepdad seems like a nice guy so there must be an explanation for his outburst on me last night. So now I can't live with my boyfriend. I can't live with my mom and stepdad. And I can't live with someone who's. Like we all already know, the advancement of the digital system has made our life is integrating with the digital system, and we often put our personal information in order to access digital platform especially internet environment. All of our activities and transactions on the internet is using our personal data as main components, and if we stopped to think at least one day we will realize how much personal information that we share on the internet and can endanger our privacy? The company. 
Sometimes i wonder if society is right about us privacy conscious people - that we all/most have mental health problems. I've been looking around on google scholar and haven't found anything to support that notion that privacy consciousness is related to mental health. In the privacy community, by which I mean those who advocate in favor of privacy and against the general apathy that people have about their private lives being public, there is a distinct tendency to often phrase things using the word "privacy" while in reality meaning something more akin to "security." At least, this is my personal interpretation. The reason for this is simple, privacy is simply one aspect of a person's security. This leads people to beat around the bush when discussing Hi guys, I'm new here. I've been on the bitcoin train since early 2017. I’ve been familiar with the concept of Monero for a while, but it wasn't until very recently that I have gone down the rabbit whole and have become fascinated with it. I am aware of the number of perks the Monero network provides compared to bitcoin (privacy, asic resistance, etc) and am wondering why, with all these perks, the Monero network is so small compared to the Bitcoin network. Is Bitcoin’s dominance 27F and 27M in happy LTR. Like many here, we couldn't keep our hands off of each other for the first 3 years or so - every time we saw each other we had sex, which was 5 times a week when we lived separately. But since Moving in together, and now, living with his parents saving for a house, we have gradually started having less sex and we just went through one of the longest dry spells in the lifetime of our relationship (6 weeks.) I know a lot of it is attributed to feeling uncomfortable 
Hi, I'm new here and want to get motivated by the risks with lack of privacy. Also I find it a little pain in the a sometimes and I would like to get some videos with short explanations about what should I do to keep my privacy and what are the risks with lacking privacy to get motivated. I saw this video "How to protect your online privacy in 2018 From noob to pro in 14 minutes or less Tutorial" - but I think its a little complicated and going too fast. Thanks ahead. Any advice on how to successfully meditate in situations where privacy is lacking, such as while staying in a friend's living room in a small apartment.
