                            <p>DownThemAll (or just dTa) is a powerful yet easy-to-use Mozilla Firefox extension that adds new advanced download capabilities to your browser. History. One of the main features of DownThemAll! was the capability for multi-part download. This feature was similar to features in GetRight and Download Accelerator. 
We just released, and mozilla approved, a new maintenance release with the version number 3.0.7. It fixes a few things, has a new disk writing backend to avoid low-memory issues in certain situations and adds Italian. I had to reset Firefox the other day, and after restart I immediately notice that ALWAYS ASK for download location was no longer working, despite basic settings. Every since Firefox broke DownloadThemAll, I have trouble downloading bulk files. I know you folks like wget, but I am perhaps not computer savy enough. Do you know if there is a firefox extension that works with the latest build. addons.mozilla.org. 
I'm going to name a name because there is no other way around. It's about 1ClickProduct developer with dozens of extensions. I'm not saying they're definitely doing something unethical, but that's what it looks like so far. The entire Top rated extensions category of AMO is filled with their extensions (https://i.imgur.com/FKh9MJj.png). The extensions have few users and lots of 5-star ratings. When you look at the user-to-rating ratio, it's remarkable that so few users decided to activel. DownThemAll! has 6 repositories available. Follow their code on GitHub. Since upgrading to v57, one of my most used extensions Downloadthemall does not work due to compatbility. Is there an equivalent equally good download manager that is compatible.  Complete integration with Mozilla Firefox. You can easily access DownThemAll from the context menu, by right-clicking on any webpage, from 'tools menu', or simply by adding our cute handy icons to your toolbar. Title. Please allow us to change the color of the blinding white new tab page. This is like looking at an uncoming car's headlights at night, even with the lights on, and running f.lux. We can't use extensions on it, so I can't even change the color to black with "Dark Background and Light Text", which is oddly like the only extension I have that works with Quantum I'm not 7 years old with advanced Alzheimer's, I don't need massive blocks indicating my recently viewed pages, I WOULD. Moved Permanently. The document has moved. 
DownloadThemAll is one of my most highly used extensions, but turns out that it is one of many which will be discontinued ( after Firefox 57. Can anyone recommend a good replacement for DownloadThemAll that will work after Firefox 57? Thanks. EDIT: I like DownloadThemAll's ability to accelerate downloads plus the function to import a list of URLs from a text files. Can this be done in a Firefox. 玩转Firefox 之 批量下载神器 -downthemall插件,Dowthemall是Firefox的一个下载管理插件。支持多线程、续传、批量文件下载，同时允许HTTP和FTP协议的免费软件。Dowthemall支持正则表达式，能够很方便的批量生成固定格式的下载链接. Hello folks! I use DownloadThemAll a lot! And I know it will end (mostly) at FF57, so, I'm trying to find a solution that allows me to save images/gifs/webm/mp4 to a pre-configured path in a contex menu. Like this: any one knows something about. So easy to use ! When Video downloadHelper detects videos, the browser toolbar icon activates. Just click on it to see the available videos, just pick the desired. One tool I find extremely useful in Firefox is the DownThemAll add-in. Unfortunately, I can't find this tool or its equivalent for any other browser, either Google Chrome or Internet Explorer. 
I've done it plenty of times in the past but now I can't. Did they something with the website to prevent soundboard downloading? When I change Details to Download it leads me to a blank page that says Access Denied. I'm using NoScript too but that was never a problem before YouTube Downloader! Download all formats: HD Video, WebM, FLV, MP4. Upload Downloaded Files to your Desktop Computer. Upload to OneDrive (SkyDrive). ~~It seems different now, I can't seem to download off of Archive.org now. It's not showing me any audio files but just random stuff off the webpage.~~ D'oh! Even though I've downloaded many many shows off of Archive, I just realized I was skipping a step: change details to download Welcome to DownThemAll!

Does anybody know of a way to download one's entire bSpace workspace without manually downloading each individual file? I'm a graduating senior and want to archive my course files. UPDATE: bSpace Support Team responded to my query with the following: "Unfortunately, students do not have the ability to mass download the resources in a bSpace site." Looks like we will just have to download it manually. 
Skip navigation Sign in. Search. Is there any option, plugin, program or some way to download every picture uploaded by a certain user from Minus.com? Haha other than downloading each one manually? XD there are tons of great SNSD pictures on Minus!! but it takes too long to save each one individually. go to Tools Menu -> Add-ons -> Extension section -> check if the DownThemAll!! add-on is there or not. By the way its called DownThemAll!! not DownloadThemAll. I am trying to download a series of media files which are listed as links (not in " format, but proper links), therefore I need a web crawler to get them. The tricky part is that these links I think they are javascript (they open in a new window), and they lead to a hosting site (i.e. they lead to another '.htm' file instead of the actual media). The almost perfect tool for the job would be the "foxyspider" add-on, which I have tried but crashes after Official DownThemAll! repository. Pull requests welcome. - downthemall/downthemall. I recall seeing a way recently to download not only a web page but all linked pages. For example, if I want to download the Wikipedia page on cats as well as all the pages it links to, what would be the best way to do this? Many thanks to those Sorry again, but I got a bit overwhelmed with/distracted by other stuff so could work less on DownThemAll! Lite than I anticipated, and I also keep running into limitations/quirks/bugs/idiocrasies of the WebExtension APIs (and sometimes HTML5 stuff as implemented by Firefox). I want to download all my images posted at ffffound.com, for instance the images on: - - - - etc. I've tried Automator (Mac/OS X), but it didn't manage 
Downloadthemall embedded $ 200 million in time ones, a appliance for the partition. At the most collection, the logon may be created to come most collection of the other repositories. Rightclickgtsave asgt Gets pretty annoying. DownThemAll! website has moved to a new location! Please update your bookmarks to this URL: (You should be automatically redirected in 5 seconds). I want to download a textbook from my library website, but each chapter is a separate pdf. How do I download all of these simultaneously, rather than clicking and "saving as" for each one? Here is the page for reference: I tried download master, an extension for google chrome, and it almost worked. Instead of downloading the PDFs though it just downloaded the links Download them all - Meilleures réponses; Downthemall firefox - Meilleures réponses; Firefox Downthemall. 
Basically I want to know how to download all .zip files on an entire website. The .zip files are accessed by clicking on a button that shows a popup with a link to download the .zip file. The button links are all on different pages of the website. Is there anyway program, marcro or anything that will allow me to download them all? Please be specific Internet Download Manager increases download speed with built-in download logic accelerator, resume and schedule downloads. Don't be put off by the title; this isn't a hatefest. I just think someone really needs to try to cut through the BS here and I'm gonna try. And I'm gonna try  First off, despite their already massive levels of wealth, I'm on board with Firefox having as many legit revenue streams as they can find (that means a lot of the criticisms there are off base, though I do wish there isn't any closed-source code that's mandatory, even if it's not activated.) Don't complain about opt-in stuff, people. Download Mozilla Firefox, a free Web browser. Firefox is created by a global non-profit dedicated to putting individuals in control online.

So I was going to make a post asking if any of you guys are doing it and would like to exchange some pointers but I see people asking what tool to download with, so I thought I'd share mine. It's written by me, in python3, take a look at the imports and do pip install of necessary dependencies (flicrapi, unidecode, to name a couple). You need to get your own API key and put it in "GET YOUR OWN API KEY" section. The script downloads per user account, so put the user IDs you want to archive. 
There's a lot of software out there for your PC. Today, the most common way to get new software is to download it from the Internet. Is this possible? I'm looking for a way to download images when browsing through news sites on Chrome. I used to use the DownloadThemAll plugin on Firefox but it's no longer maintained. I'd like a way to click on an embedded jpeg and have it go through the 'right clickgt save asgt save' procedure all at once. Maybe it'd have to be a combined ctrl+LMB, or an extended LMB press that does all this. (Or LMB then RMB while LMB is still pressed) I'm new to AHC but is what I'm looking Maxthon provides you with the fastest web browser available for Windows, Android, iOS, macOS, PC, Mobile Phone, Mac, iPhone and iPad.

In the recent past, I used extensions like DownloadThemAll or Snap Links Plus. However, I think they no longer work on the updated Firefox. I download a lot of files, especially PDFs, that are hyperlinked. How do you do it, without clicking on every single link manually.
